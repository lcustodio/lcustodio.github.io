Experienced Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in a wide range of industries from electrical and electronic manufacturing industry to supply chain automation and business process management across start-ups in North, South America and Europe. Recently worked with teams distributed across three time zones.

## Practices

Focused on practices and building the right things in the right way. This includes software craftsmanship, XP, CI/CD.

## Projects

Being involved in a variety of projects I had the chance to work at many tiers of development stack. From reading RFID tags, adjusting antennas, re-writing drivers, to distributed databases deployed on scale. Always looking for a good team, good practices and space for deliver value.
